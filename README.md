# ChallengeN2

During this challange I added a html and a css page to work with a fitness web page about changing body composition. One of the new things that I did try was to 
add flexboxes, a video, and two images next to each other. Finally, I had alot of fun doing this hope that on my next challange I can feel confident enought 
to use JS.

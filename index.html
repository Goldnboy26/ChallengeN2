       <p> body weigth movements along with mobility paths are the best combination in order to get anyone started in their way to an incredible shape.

        program to get you to the shape of your drams.

        The “calories in versus calories out” model is based on the idea that to maintain a stable weight, the number of calories you eat needs to match the number you expend. 
        “Calories in” refers to the calories you get from the foods you eat, while “calories out” is the number of calories you burn.

        <ul class="flex-container flex-start">
          <li class="flex-item">strength</li>
        </ul>
        Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance.
        It is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as calisthenics, isometrics, and plyometrics.

        </ul>
       Hypertrophy training focuses mostly on developing your muscles. You'll focus on increasing the size of your muscle fibers, developing large muscles in areas that you work out the most. 
       This might be places like your thighs, calves, biceps, or back. Hypertrophy focuses more on moderate weight and moderate repetitions.

      </ul>
       Aerobic exercise is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process.
      "Aerobic" is defined as "relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen", and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately.
